This is most likely becuase the AI may have not been able to find the proper subjects, and if it did, the AI may not have been able to percieve it as real. A lot of AI art is not real of course, so I wonder if the AI can only detect real versus 'fake'. Fake being real-life subejects. The only one it was close on was the dog catching the ball, but instead of the a ball it said it was a frisbee."
