# CSC 360 Deep Learning

## Overview

This repository contains **notes, assignments, and projects** for the CSC 360 Deep Learning course. The materials cover foundational and practical topics in deep learning using PyTorch, including:

- **PyTorch Basics:** Tensors, modules, training loops, and optimizers.
- **Data Representation:** How to load and preprocess images, tabular data, time series, and text for deep learning models.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Building and training CNNs for image classification tasks.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Sequence modeling for time series and text data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets, and visualizing loss and accuracy.

The main folder contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and code examples for each topic.

## Hand Gesture Recognition Model

In addition to the course notes, this repository includes a custom hand gesture recognition model **used in two programs found in the hand_gesture_cnn file directory**. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to classify hand gestures from images. The workflow includes:

- **Data Preparation:** Loading and preprocessing hand gesture images.
- **Model Architecture:** Building a CNN tailored for gesture recognition.
- **Training:** Using PyTorch to train the model on labeled gesture data.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance and visualizing results.

This project showcases how the concepts learned in class can be applied to solve real-world computer vision problems.
